-[ mobs ]-

  When an NPC mob is felled, have them enter a lay-down state (animation frame?)
and if not damaged further, give a chance of spawning a zombie.  After that,
eliminate zombies auto-spawning, optionally increasing rate of NPC spawn.
  If NPC is in lay-down (dead) state, and received damage, destroy the body and
eliminate chance of zombie.

  Possibly spawn a zombie as fresh bones turn old, or at some point when players
being punching bones left by players.
