* [admin infinite stock dispensers]
"Block dispenses a selected item, like a shop, but much more admin oriented.
It should have a formspec to select how much can each user get of dispensed
item. (example: 1 every 10 mins. 1 per player. 10 per player. etc.) (If not
possible, only one per player :P) (optional features) price selector."

I just miss that thing :)
https://github.com/prestidigitator/mine ... prestibags
Simple bags. You can fill a bag with things then pick it up to your inventory.
https://github.com/kaeza/minetest-wiki
Just fun thing.
https://github.com/Megaf/more_chests
This mod contains shared chests and "wi-fi" chest similar to our ender chest
https://github.com/stujones11/shooter
This mod contains basic guns, rocket launcher, grenader, turret, grappling hook gun, crossbow and flare gun. I'd recommend you to turn off crossbow (arrows may be buggy).
+Basic guns don't do any damage to players that wear diamond armor (very weak) so you can turn them off too.
+Explosions don't destroy nodes
https://github.com/paramat/spacesuit
Just funny thing ripped from moontest game, gives you infinite breath when it is in your inventory.
https://github.com/Bremaweb/stairpick
You can turn nodes into stairs with just hitting them with a stairpick.
https://github.com/ChaosWormz/teleport-request
Players complained that there are no commands like /tpr, so I think that mod may be useful.
https://github.com/Sokomine/travelnet
It will perfectly fit in your game if you rip travelnet boxes and leave only elevators.
https://github.com/metalstache/wrench
Cheaty thing that makes possible to pick up chest full of items (like prestibag).
This version doesn't require fat technic mod.
